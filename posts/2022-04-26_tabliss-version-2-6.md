## Automatic website icons for Quick Links

A long requested feature that will make adding new Quick Links quicker and
easier. Tabliss can now automatically retrieve the favicon for websites in your
Quick Links widget.

## Pause button for Unsplash background rotation

You can now pause and resume Unsplash background rotation directly from your
Dashboard.

## New bug fixes

- There is no longer an flash of black as Tabliss loads if you are using a light
  background luminosity.
- Adding a todo item with the keyboard shortcut will no longer add the shortcut
  key to your new todo.
