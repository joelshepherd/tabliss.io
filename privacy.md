# Privacy Policy

<p class="lead">Tabliss does not store any information about or from you, besides error reports. Your settings are saved securely within your browser and never transmitted to Us.
</p>

## Scope

This privacy policy covers the Tabliss browser extension and web version.

## Terms

- **Tabliss** - The Tabliss browser extension and web version
- **We/Us** - The developer of Tabliss
- **External Service** - A service providing content to Tabliss, such as
  Unsplash

## Data usage

### Settings

Your settings control what Tabliss displays on your dashboard. Your settings are
stored securely within your browser. We do not store a copy of your settings.

If you use a background or widget that is powered by an External Service, your
settings for that service will be provided to it. For example, if you choose
Unsplash with a custom search term for your background, that search term will be
sent to Unsplash to retrieve matching images.

### Error reports

Error reports are generated when Tabliss encounters a failure or crash. These
error reports are used by Us to determine the cause of the error and (hopefully)
fix it. This is the only data collected by Us, and it is stored in the Sentry
error tracker software. Information that may be present in a typical error
report:

- The details of the error message
- The part of the code the error occurred in
- The last few actions taken before the error occurred
- The browser being used
- The operating system being used
- The IP address being used

## Changes and support

We will occasionally update this privacy policy and publish the changes here. If
you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:
[support@tabliss.io](mailto:support@tabliss.io).
