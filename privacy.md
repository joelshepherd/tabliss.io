# Privacy Policy

This privacy policy covers the Tabliss web extension.

- Tabliss does not collect any data (of any kind), other than error reports.
- Your settings are stored securely within your browser.
- The only time a setting leaves your browser is when an "extras" plugin (like GIPHY or Unsplash) connects to their service to retrieve some information (like an image) that matches the setting.
- Tabliss will occasionally update this privacy policy and publish the changes here.

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: [support@tabliss.io](mailto:support@tabliss.io).
