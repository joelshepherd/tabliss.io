## My widgets have disappeared

Widgets can be toggled on and off using the "eye" icon in the top left corner of
the screen, next to the settings cog. Widgets can also be toggled with the "W"
keyboard shortcut.

## Tabliss displays a Storage Error

Tabliss is unable to load or save settings. This is most commonly caused by
private browsing mode; but permissions, disk space, or a corrupt browser profile
can also cause issues.

- **Check you are not in private or incognito browsing mode**
  - This is important when using the web version of Tabliss
  - This includes permanent private modes like Firefox's "Never remember
    history" settings
- **Check you have plenty of disk space available on your device**
  - Browsers can, and will, delete browser storage if your disk space is low
  - Choosing the "Persist Setting" option in the settings menu will ask the
    browser not to clear your settings, even when disk space is low
- **Check your browser profile is not corrupt**
  - On Firefox, you can use the
    "[Refresh Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/refresh-firefox-reset-add-ons-and-settings)"
    option to reset
  - On Chrome, you can
    [create a new profile](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824) to
    test if it works there

## Tabliss reports a cache error

This error will cause Tabliss to take longer to load, and will prevent it from
remembering images you upload to the "Upload Image" background. This error is
caused by the same issues that cause the "Storage Error" above, and can be fixed
with the same steps.

## Can I use Google Fonts in Tabliss?

Yes you can! Follow the steps below:

1. Find your favourite Google Font
1. Press "Select this font" and open the embed pop-up at the bottom
1. Under Embed Fonts, copy the `@import` embed line (not the `<style>` lines,

   box
1. Back in Google Fonts, copy the font name from the Specify in CSS section
1. Back in Tabliss, paste the font name in the Font field under a widget's Font
   Settings
1. Enjoy Tabliss in your font!
